<h3 style="font-family:Didot;margin:0;padding-top:5px"">Temasek Singapore</h3>
<p style="font-family:Didot;margin:0;font-size:90%">Prior to colonial Singapore, Fort Canning was known as Bukit Larangan or Forbidden Hill. It is believed that ancient Singapore kings were buried there, and that the hill is haunted. There was once a palace built on the hill, and subsequently a settlment named <i>Ban Zu</i> in the 14th century.
<br> Likely a translation from the Malay word <i>pancur</i>, <i>Ban Zu</i> means a spring or stream. There used to be a spring west of the hill, called <i>pancur larangan</i> or "forbidden spring", where the women of the ruler's household were said to bathe. Later in the 19th Century, this same spring was the main water source for ships that stopped over. However, the demand overpowered the supply and the spring dried up.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Didot;margin:0;padding-top:5px">Early Colonial Singapore</h3>
<p style="font-family:Didot;margin:0;font-size:90%">As Sir Stamford Raffles settled in Singapore,  he built his residence on the hill, sharing it with other governments and government officials, making it known as Government Hill. It was where Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein signed the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the British Government, handing governance of Singapore to the British.
<br> The hill was known as the Singapore Hill, where the first British Settlement was set up. In 1822, Raffles established the first Botanical Gardens on that same grounds, however, gardening experiments failed and was abandoned in 1829.
<br> 
A Christian cemetery used to exist on the hill, serving as the burial ground for early Europeans in Singapore. Two classical monuments, and some headstones placed along brick walls remained at the site. Tombs were exhumed, and the tombstones were embedded into surviving walls.</p>

  <div>
<h3 style="font-family:Didot;margin:0;padding-top:5px"">Military Singapore</h3>
<p style="font-family:Didot;margin:0;font-size:90%">By 1859, due to the absence of harbour defence, the hill served a military role. The residence was demolished, and a fort with an arms store, barracks and a hospital was built. The fort was renamed Fort Canning after Viscount Charles John Canning, then Governor-General and the first Viceroy of India. Despite the seven 68-pounders, eight 8-inch shell guns and two 13-inch shell guns that were added, the fortifications were rendered useless and demolished, as attacking ships were out of range. 
<br> A military headquarters - Headquarters Malaya Command Operations Bunker - was then built with underground rooms serving as operations centre. This was where Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. </p>

Attempts were made to renew Van Kleef Aqaurium, but there was no success. Closed in 1996, the building was demolished in 1998. </p>
